# Current State

_Last updated: April 2026_

## Source-of-truth order (phased model)

### Phase 1 — Current (pre-canonicalization)

Reconciliation between HTML and DB is complete (HTML→DB gap = 0, DB→HTML gap = 0 as of April 2026). Both are valid sources; keep them in sync.

1. Site HTML (`docs/pillars/*.html`) — rendered policy cards; most recently edited content
2. `data/policy_catalog_v2.sqlite` — 3,810 positions in v2 ID format; canonical structured catalog
3. `pillars/` narrative markdown — prose source; may lag behind site HTML
4. Historical source logs (`sources/branch_*`) — reference only

**Any new position added to HTML must be backfilled into the DB in the same commit.**

### Phase 2 — Post-canonicalization (target)

Once PolicyOS and the generation pipeline are complete:

1. `data/policy_catalog_v2.sqlite` — canonical source of truth for all policy positions
2. `pillars/*/overview.md` and `pillars/*/policy.md` — source for narrative prose
3. `docs/pillars/*.html` — generated output; do not hand-edit policy cards
4. Historical source logs — reference only

## Site structure (live)

The site (`docs/`) serves the published platform at https://alistardust.github.io/freedom-and-dignity-project/.

**Current pillar count: 25** across 5 foundations. All live at `docs/pillars/<slug>.html`.

Each pillar page uses:
- `<style>:root { --accent-color: #...; }</style>` — per-pillar accent color only
- All other styles from `docs/assets/css/style.css` (shared, DRY)
- `docs/assets/js/data.js` — `window.ARP` — source of truth for foundations + pillar registry
- `docs/assets/js/app.js` — injects nav links, WIP banner, Roadmap link, scrollspy, dynamic counts

## Frontend architecture

### JavaScript
- `app.js` — central injection hub: nav/footer links, WIP banner, Roadmap link, section-reveal IntersectionObserver, pil-snav scrollspy, `[data-dynamic]` count fills
- `data.js` — `window.ARP` object: foundations array, pillars array, helper methods
- No frameworks. Vanilla ES5-compatible JS.

### CSS
- `style.css` — all shared styles (no inline CSS in HTML except `--accent-color` per pillar)
- `--accent-color` CSS variable used throughout for per-pillar theming of policy cards, nav pills, research headings

### Dynamic values
- `[data-dynamic="pillar-count"]` — filled from `ARP.pillars.length`
- `[data-dynamic="foundation-count"]` — filled from `ARP.foundations.length`
- `[data-dynamic="policy-count"]` — counts `.policy-card` elements on current page
- `[data-dynamic="family-count"]` — counts unique family prefixes on current page

## Catalog state (`data/policy_catalog_v2.sqlite`)

Rebuilt April 2026. Reconciliation gap = 0 (HTML and DB in sync).

### Current totals

- 3,810 positions (`XXXX-XXXX-0000` v2 ID format)
- 506 subdomains
- 3,810 legacy ID mappings (provenance)
- `plain_language` column populated for all positions (backfill complete)

To rebuild: `python3 scripts/build-catalog-v2.py`

## PolicyOS

System-rules layer in development. Three-layer hierarchy:

1. **Platform values** — `policyos/policyos_platform_values_v1.md`
2. **System principles** — `policyos/policyos_1_0_rules_proposal.md`
3. **Authoring OS** — `policyos/policyos_authoring_os_v1.md`

See the handoff file and README in `policyos/` for current status.

## Known open items

- **Citation fixes** — orphan footnote wiring and uncited statistics in progress (automated agents running)
- **PolicyOS canonicalization** — values layer locked; principles and authoring OS under review
- **Plain language** — all 3,810 positions have `rule-plain` descriptions
- **Science/Technology/Space content** — live page; content in development


## Source-of-truth order (phased model)

### Phase 1 — Current (pre-reconciliation)

The site HTML and the DB have both been edited since last reconciliation. A full 3-way audit is in progress. Until it completes, use the following hierarchy:

1. Site HTML (`docs/pillars/*.html`) — 2,935 policy cards; most recently edited content
2. `data/policy_catalog.sqlite` — 1,554 `policy_items`; some entries not yet on site; some site cards not yet in DB
3. `pillars/` narrative markdown — prose source; may be behind the site HTML
4. Historical source logs (`sources/branch_*`) — reference only; used in initial catalog build

**Divergences between HTML and DB are flagged for human review.** Neither source auto-overrides the other. `MISSING` in the DB does not reliably mean the position is absent from the site.

### Phase 2 — Post-reconciliation (target)

Once the reconciliation audit is complete:

1. `data/policy_catalog.sqlite` — canonical source of truth for all policy positions
2. `pillars/*/overview.md` and `pillars/*/policy.md` — source for narrative prose
3. `docs/pillars/*.html` — generated output; do not hand-edit policy cards
4. Historical source logs — reference only

## Site structure (live)

The site (`docs/`) serves the published platform at https://alistardust.github.io/freedom-and-dignity-project/.

**Current pillar count: 25** across 5 foundations. All live at `docs/pillars/<slug>.html`.

Each pillar page uses:

- All other styles from `docs/assets/css/style.css` (shared, DRY)
- `docs/assets/js/data.js` — `window.ARP` — source of truth for foundations + pillar registry

## Frontend architecture

### JavaScript
- `app.js` — central injection hub: nav/footer links, WIP banner, Roadmap link, section-reveal IntersectionObserver, pil-snav scrollspy, `[data-dynamic]` count fills
- `data.js` — `window.ARP` object: foundations array, pillars array, helper methods
- No frameworks. Vanilla ES5-compatible JS.

### CSS
- `style.css` — all shared styles (no inline CSS in HTML except `--accent-color` per pillar)
- `--accent-color` CSS variable used throughout for per-pillar theming of policy cards, nav pills, research headings

### Dynamic values
- `[data-dynamic="pillar-count"]` — filled from `ARP.pillars.length`
- `[data-dynamic="foundation-count"]` — filled from `ARP.foundations.length`
- `[data-dynamic="policy-count"]` — counts `.policy-card` elements on current page
- `[data-dynamic="family-count"]` — counts unique family prefixes on current page

## Catalog state (data/policy_catalog.sqlite)

The DB was last rebuilt from source logs in 2025. It is **pre-reconciliation** — it does not fully reflect policy cards added to the site HTML after that point, and some DB entries are not yet on the site.

### Current totals (pre-reconciliation)

- 1,554 `policy_items` (structured positions with prefixed IDs)
- `legacy_policy_items` (old numeric checkpoint items, preserved for provenance)
- 36 `record_links`
- 629 `prose_rule_mentions`

**Important:** DB status fields (`MISSING`, `INCLUDED`, etc.) reflect the state at last catalog build and have not been reconciled against the current site HTML. A `MISSING` entry may already be present on the site under a policy card. Do not treat DB status as authoritative until after the reconciliation audit. Rebuild the catalog with `scripts/import_policy_catalog.py` once source logs and HTML are reconciled.

## Known issues for human review

- **Reconciliation audit** — HTML (2,935 policy cards) and DB (1,554 policy_items) have diverged. A full 3-way reconciliation (HTML ↔ DB ↔ source logs) is the primary open infrastructure item. Until complete, treat both sources as valid and flag divergences for human review.
- **Policy card ID audit** — a systematic scan of all `.policy-card` IDs for duplicates or format violations has not been done. Spot checks pass; a full audit is warranted before v1.0.
- **Orphan footnotes** — several pillar pages have footnotes defined in the reference list but never cited inline. Pages: `immigration.html` (fn1, fn3), `technology-and-ai.html` (fn1–fn3), `consumer-rights.html` (fn3), `courts-and-judicial-system.html` (fn5–fn6), `elections-and-representation.html` (fn4–fn7), `environment-and-agriculture.html` (fn3), `gun-policy.html` (fn4–fn5), `legislative-reform.html` (fn4), `term-limits-and-fitness.html` (fn3–fn4). These may represent content removed without updating the reference list, or inline citations accidentally omitted.
- **Foreign policy in related pillars** — `foreign-policy.html` is not yet referenced in "Related Pillars" sections of other pillar pages.
- **Compare page narratives** — the strengths/weaknesses narrative sections in compare pages do not yet discuss the foreign policy pillar.
- **Science/Technology/Space content** — `science-technology-space.html` is live but content is in development.

## Test suite

- **Unit (Vitest):** `npm run test:unit` — 42 tests, all passing
- **E2E (Playwright/Firefox):** `npm run test:e2e` — 222 tests, all passing
- `PILLAR_COUNT` constant in both test files — update when adding pillars

## Scaffolding tools

- `scripts/new-pillar.js` — generate a new pillar HTML page from CLI args
- `scripts/import_policy_catalog.py` — rebuild `data/policy_catalog.sqlite` from chat logs
